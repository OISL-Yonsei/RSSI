## Abstract
We propose a novel single-shot wide-field imaging method that maps local temporal intensity decorrelations of dynamic speckle fields. Our method, named rolling shutter speckle imaging (RSSI), utilizes short time intervals between each row of a rolling shutter complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (RS-CMOS) image sensor to discern fast temporal changes in the speckle field, which otherwise require sequential measurements with high-speed cameras. RSSI generates elongated speckle patterns on an RS-CMOS image sensor and quantifies temporal decorrelations of speckle fields from row-by-row intensity correlations (RICs) within a single image. To quantify the local speckle decorrelation times of the dynamic scattering media, we derived a theoretical model for RIC and verified the model using numerical simulations and flow-phantom experiments. Further, our *in vivo* imaging results show that RSSI can map the flow rate distributions in the cerebral blood vessels with the correction of static scattering in the tissue, demonstrating that RSSI is a powerful and cost-effective imaging tool for *in vivo* quantitative blood flow measurements.
